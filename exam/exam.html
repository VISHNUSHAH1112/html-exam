                <h1>SHOPE LOCAL</h1> <p>We know that during COVID-19, a lot of folks <br> around the city and state are feeling uneasy about  <br>the future - we’re not sure what the future holds <br> either. <br>

                    That said: we know that we love making sure you <br>have the gear you need for your adventures, and <br> we’re going to keep doing that - with our team - <br> until the city tells us we can’t. <br>
                    
                    But as long as folks like yourself support small <br> businesses around the city, then we’ll be here — <br> every day, making sure your orders arrive on time. <br><br>
